Hamm and his twin brother, Morgan, met last weekend with USA Gymnastics officials and plan to participate in a limited number of events in 2007. Paul Hamm won the gold medal in the all-around in Athens in 2004. Soon after, the International Gymnastics Federation acknowledged a scoring error involving Yang Tae-young, a South Korean who wound up with the bronze. When the Koreans protested, the federation suggested Hamm share the medal. But Hamm defended his gold all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.", "snippet": "The Olympic champion Paul Hamm has decided to return to competitive gymnastics, hoping for a less tumultuous path to the all-around title at the Beijing Olympic Games than the one he took in Athens.
