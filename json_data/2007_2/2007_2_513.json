Gordon Reise said he received death threats after a missed call on an onside kick near the end of a game that the Ducks won, 34-33, on Sept. 16. Replays showed that the Sooners had recovered the kick, but Reise said he did not see that view in the booth. Conference officials informed Reise last week that he was relieved of his replay duties. He will remain a technical assistant, making about $350 a game.", "snippet": "The Pacific-10 Conference replay official who missed a call during the Oklahoma-Oregon game last season has been told he will not handle replays anymore.
