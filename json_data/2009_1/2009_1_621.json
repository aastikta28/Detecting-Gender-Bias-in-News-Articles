The court issued its refusal Dec. 17. Ron Gipp and Karl Gipp filed the suit in November 2007, a month after Gipp\u2019s body was exhumed to determine if he had fathered a child out of wedlock before his death in 1920. DNA testing produced negative results. The suit accused those responsible for the exhumation of trespassing. Other family members said the testing was justified.", "snippet": "The legal fight over exhuming the remains of the Notre Dame great George Gipp may have ended, now that the Michigan Court of Appeals has refused to hear an appeal of a decision that rejected a lawsuit filed by two men who say they are Gipp\u2019s...", "subsection_name": "College Football", "male": ["George"]}]
