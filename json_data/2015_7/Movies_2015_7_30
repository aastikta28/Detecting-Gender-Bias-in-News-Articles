In court, the traumatized child pointed the finger at her brother, Ben, and her testimony put the troubled teen in prison for life. Twenty-five years later, a broke and desperate Libby has run through donations from a sympathetic public and royalties from her autobiography, without ever moving past the events of that night. When Libby accepts a fee to appear at a gathering of true-crime aficionados led by Lyle Wirth, she is shocked to learn most believe Ben is innocent and that the real killer is still at large. She reluctantly agrees to help them reexamine the crime. As Libby and Lyle dig deeper into the circumstances surrounding the murders, her recollections start to unravel and she is forced to question exactly what she saw-or didn't see. As long-buried memories resurface, Libby confronts the wrenching truths that led up to that horrific night. Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn.", "headline": {"main": "Dark Places: Jail Visit"}, "snippet": "Libby Day was seven-years-old when her mother and two sisters were brutally murdered in their rural Kansas farmhouse.
