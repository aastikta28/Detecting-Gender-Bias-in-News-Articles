The award is given annually to the coaches of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s N.C.A.A. basketball champions, and Summitt may return next season. She lost only two seniors, and she kept the 6-foot-4 Candace Parker, probably the best player in the women\u2019s game. The Volunteers also have one of the strongest recruiting classes in the nation with Angie Bjorklund, a 6-1 guard-forward from Spokane, Wash.; Kelley Cain, a 6-6 center from Atlanta; Vicki Baugh, a 6-4 forward-center from Sacramento; and Sydney Smallbone, a 6-0 guard from South Bend, Ind. \u201cWe have a chance to be a very good team next year,\u201d Summitt said at a news conference. Donovan, however, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very young. We\u2019re starting over. We lose our top six players.\u201d Four of those six were underclassmen who have declared for the N.B.A. draft.", "snippet": "Billy Donovan, who coached the Florida men\u2019s team to its second consecutive N.C.A.A. title last month, and Pat Summitt, who coached the Tennessee women to their seventh title in her 33 years on the job, received the annual Winged Foot Awards last...", "subsection_name": "College Basketball", "male": ["Billy"]}]
