Athletes seem to be conspiring to inflict as much bodily harm as possible between whistles. You can almost here the U.F.C. folks thinking, ''And we're still illegal anywhere?'' Things have gone officially around the bend when the night the Miami Heat finally shook off their funk and obliterated the Pacers, they decided to do their ''Bad Boys'' imitation and get everyone talking about flying elbows instead of acrobatic dunks. Yes, this was the Heat and despite Udonis Haslem's self-serving claim that championships are won in the trenches, the Heat are about LeBron James and Dwyane Wade playing in a different stratosphere, writes Greg Cote in The Miami Herald. Which is why Tuesday night's flagrant foul fest was so absurd, as Ken Berger writes on CBSSports.com, the Heat defending their ''toughness'' with far too many cheap shots. The Heat's swarming defense, which Zach Lowe writes on SI.com is what turned this series around, doesn't need role players like Dexter Pittman adding a layer of thuggery.", "snippet": "A festival of fouls, some flagrant, in the Heat-Pacers game.
