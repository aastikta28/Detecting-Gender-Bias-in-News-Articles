Britton sank a 5-foot putt to save par on the 18th green at Manasquan River Golf Club in Brielle, and then sat back and watched Esposito miss a short but slippery birdie putt to win the $57,000 tournament. Esposito ran his first putt 6 feet past the hole. He then missed his par putt coming back up the hill to give Britton a one-shot victory.
