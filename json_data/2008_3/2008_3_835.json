Jones turned herself in before noon at Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, a prison spokeswoman said. Under the terms of her sentencing, she had until Tuesday to surrender. Although the prison specializes in medical and mental health services, it also has inmates who do not require such care. After frequently denying ever having used performance-enhancing drugs, Jones admitted she had lied to federal investigators in November 2003. Jones also admitted lying about her knowledge of the involvement of Tim Montgomery, the father of her older son, in a scheme to cash millions of dollars worth of stolen or forged checks.", "snippet": "Marion Jones began her six-month sentence in federal prison Friday, punishment for lying to investigators about her use of performance-enhancing drugs and her role in a check-fraud scam.
