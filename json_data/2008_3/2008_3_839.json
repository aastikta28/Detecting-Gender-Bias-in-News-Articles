With a win by Pyro a month after his breathtaking last-to-first Risen Star victory, Asmussen, who trained last year&#8217;s Horse of the Year, Curlin, would have a leading Kentucky Derby contender for the second consecutive year. A strong effort by the sprint whiz J Be K will put that colt in the Derby picture as well.Asmussen also trains the Risen Star runner-up Z Fortune, who is set to run in the Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park on March 15 in Hot Springs, Ark. At Aqueduct, Giant Moon, sporting a 4-for-4 record, is up against nine rivals in the $250,000 Gotham Stakes at 1 1-16th mile. Giant Moon, a hard-fought neck win in the Count Fleet on Jan. 5, will take on Visionaire, trained by Michael Matz, plus three 3-year-olds from the trainer Todd Pletcher &#151; Holidaze, Southern Terminus and Texas Wildcatter.", "snippet": "The trainer Steve Asmussen will look to extend his hot streak Saturday when he sends out the favorite Pyro and his stablemate J Be K in the $600,000 Louisiana Derby at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans.
