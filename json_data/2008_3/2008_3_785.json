Cink went from four shots behind to two shots ahead in a stretch of five holes, and despite a 30-mile-an-hour wind and 50-degree temperatures, he did not make a bogey until he was on the 18th hole. Cink was at five-under 208, two shots ahead of the former United States Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, who had a 69.
