Wilkins, the St. Louis Rams\u2019 career-leading scorer and the best active long-range kicker in the N.F.L., announced his retirement Friday after 14 seasons.Shortly afterward, Brown was on the move. Brown, who spent the last five seasons with Seattle, was seventh in the league in scoring in 2007 with a career-high 127 points, including 28 of 34 field-goal attempts. He was a top priority for the Seahawks to re-sign last month, and Seattle was believed to have offered him $14 million to stay.The Rams, however, offered more. Linehan said the Rams judged Brown the best free agent available at any position.Wilkins, 35, had 1,223 points and 265 field goals with the Rams, finding a home after playing one season for the Eagles and two for the 49ers. He also leads the franchise in field-goal attempts (328) and had a success rate of 80.8 percent. He retired with chronic leg and lower back problems.From 49 yards or longer, Wilkins was 39 for 50 for his career and 38 for 49 with the Rams. Among active kickers with 20 or more attempts, his 78 percent success rate from 49 yards or longer is the best in the N.F.L. and his 25 field goals are the most in league history.", "snippet": "The St. Louis Rams replaced the retiring kicker Jeff Wilkins almost immediately, signing Josh Brown away from the Seattle Seahawks and giving him a $4 million bonus \u2014 the league\u2019s largest for a kicker.Brown\u2019s full deal would be worth $14.2...", "subsection_name": "Pro Football", "male": ["Jeff"]}]
