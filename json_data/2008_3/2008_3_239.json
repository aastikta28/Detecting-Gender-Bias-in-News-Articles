The 49ers and the Bears will also exchange their picks in the third round, giving the Bears San Francisco\u2019s seventh pick, while the Niners will get the Bears\u2019 pick at No. 12. Briggs was with the Bears last season when reports surfaced that the 49ers had had contact with Briggs\u2019s agent, Drew Rosenhaus. The Bears had made Briggs their franchise player in 2007, and Briggs, who was angered by the move, stated he would not return to the Bears after he played out his one-year contract.
