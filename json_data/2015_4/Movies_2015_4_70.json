She loves her husband but doesn't trust him. Ekta's brother, Lucky, is dumb and he loves Daisy, who doesn't know that he can't speak. ACP Madhav Ghai is in love with Gopal's sister, Esha. However, Gopal and the ACP hate each other. Then there is Laxman Prasad Apte who is in love with Mira, but will not be accepted by her family until he gets a job. One day a body is found at Blue Cross Street, and Gopal is the prime suspect for the murder, because he was heard threatening to kill the victim, Subodh Mehra. Although innocent, Gopal is hard pressed for an alibi on the night of the murder. That night, he had saved a damsel in distress from a few goons. Both their cars were damaged in the fight and they had no option but to spend the night on a friend's vacant yacht. Unless Gopal finds the girl, he can't prove his innocence.  As luck would have it, the inspector investigating the murder is Gopal's archenemy ACP Madhav Sing Ghai. Gopal insulted him when he came to investigate a drug smuggling charge at Golden Fisheries, the company where both Gopal and the victim used to work. Now Gopal has two problems -- explaining to his very suspicious wife Ekta where he spent the night and explaining to the police that he is innocent. Meanwhile, a jobless Laxman Prasad Apte requests Gopal to give him Subodh Mehra's now vacant post. Gopal agrees to give him the job on the condition that he pretends to be Anthony Gonzales. While all this is happening, Lucky tries to help Gopal, who he knows is innocent. Nobody knows who Anthony Gonzales is. And there is still no sign of the girl Gopal saved on the night of the murder.", "snippet": "Gopal is married to Ekta. She loves her husband but doesn't trust him.
