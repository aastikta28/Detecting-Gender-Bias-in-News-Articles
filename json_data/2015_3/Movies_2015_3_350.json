In spite of a long losing streak, Axel will still bet on anything and is in debt to his bookies for $44,000, far more than he can afford to pay back. After borrowing money from his mother, grandfather, and girlfriend, Axel still owes thousands of dollars to a bookie named Hips who is growing impatient. Finally, Axel wins big again, but instead of paying Hips, he keeps the money, gambles with is, and loses it all. Now in debt to several bookies again, Axel starts getting threatening visits from several \"collectors\" from the underworld.", "snippet": "Axel Freed is a well-respected professor of literature at a New York university and he has a serious gambling addiction.
