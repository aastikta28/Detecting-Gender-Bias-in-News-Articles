Andrew Duncan, told The Chicago Tribune in a story posted on its Web site. Johnson had been going 40 miles an hour in a 25 m.p.h. zone when the officer &#8220;made observations that led him to believe Johnson was impaired,&#8221; Duncan said. Earlier this month, Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, suspended Johnson for eight games for violating the league&#8217;s toughened personal conduct policy.", "snippet": "Arizona police pulled over Chicago Bears defensive tackle Tank Johnson early yesterday morning, the latest legal trouble for a player already suspended for the first eight games of the 2007 season.
