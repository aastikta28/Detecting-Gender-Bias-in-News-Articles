The university confirmed that four players were temporarily expelled from July 1 through the end of the summer semester in mid-August for their roles in the April 1 fight. The players&#8217; names were not released because of federal confidentiality laws, the university said, but defense lawyers have identified the four as safety Anthony Scirrotto, defensive lineman Chris Baker, linebacker Jerome Hayes and cornerback Lydell Sargeant. Two other players were put on permanent probation and ordered to attend counseling, and four were put on probation for a year. The discipline is separate from any punishment Coach Joe Paterno may impose.", "snippet": "Penn State disciplined 10 players for their roles in an off-campus fight in which at least two people were hurt.
