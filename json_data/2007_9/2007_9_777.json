He and Bailes added that Benoit&#8217;s use of anabolic steroids, which could have contributed to Benoit&#8217;s mental state, would not have caused the brain damage they found.With the permission of Benoit&#8217;s father, Michael, Bailes and Cantu examined Benoit&#8217;s brain tissue on behalf of the Sports Legacy Institute, a nonprofit organization that investigates the effects of brain injuries in sports. Its president, Christopher Nowinski, is a former World Wrestling Entertainment performer who retired after sustaining several concussions.", "snippet": "Chris Benoit, a professional wrestler who killed his wife, son and then himself in suburban Atlanta in June, had brain damage caused by repeated concussions in the ring, two leading neurosurgeons said yesterday.Dr. Julian Bailes of West Virginia...", "subsection_name": "More Sports", "male": ["Chris", "Julian", "Robert", "Michael", "Christopher"]}]
