Despite a leader board covered with American red numbers, perhaps the most poignant moment of a gray afternoon was Jack Nicklaus, the United States captain, instructing Phil Mickelson and Woody Austin to concede a three-and-a-half-foot par putt on the 18th hole that assured Mike Weir of Canada and his International team its only point of the opening session.It was typical of Nicklaus, who famously conceded a putt about the same distance to Tony Jacklin in the 1969 Ryder Cup that allowed those matches to end in a tie. That gesture became a symbol of sportsmanship in match play between countries and continents. Then again, this was only the first day, and it was clear the Americans were in charge.", "snippet": "The Americans got off to a near-perfect start yesterday in the Presidents Cup, getting superb play from veterans and rookies alike in winning five and a half points out of the six alternate-shot matches at Royal Montreal.
