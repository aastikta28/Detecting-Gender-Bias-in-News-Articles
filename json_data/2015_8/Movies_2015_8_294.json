Assuming they'll go their separate ways and never meet again, they're both shocked when she walks in to audition for a role in the play alongside his actress wife Delta and nails her audition so well that he has no choice but to cast her. If that didn't make rehearsals awkward enough, the play's leading man is Delta's former flame who is not-so-secretly still in love with her - and is also in the unique position of having witnessed Arnold's indiscretion with Izzy. Izzy looks for guidance from her therapist Jane, a sarcastic narcissist who may well be the worst therapist on the planet, but she's no help as she's consumed with her own failing relationship with Arnold's playwright Josh, a nice guy who's developing a crush on starlet Izzy.", "snippet": "Gearing up for the production of his latest play, Broadway director Arnold Albertson arrives in New York City ahead of his family and treats himself to a one-night stand with spunky, charismatic Brooklynite Izzy.
