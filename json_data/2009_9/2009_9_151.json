Justice Shirley Kornreich of State Supreme Court said BMW Oracle Racing, owned by the software tycoon Larry Ellison, must provide Alinghi, which is based in Switzerland, with the final documentation at least two weeks before Feb. 8 &#151; the starting date for the showdown off <a href=\"http://www.raktourism.com/\" title=\"A tourism Web site.\">Ras al-Khaimah</a>, United Arab Emirates. Alinghi has been demanding the documentation for more than a year as part of a bitter legal fight. The ruling means BMW Oracle Racing can continue to modify its trimaran, including installing an engine to trim the sails and move ballast.
