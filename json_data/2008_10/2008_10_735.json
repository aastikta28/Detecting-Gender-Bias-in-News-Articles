Zarkava was impressive enough in winning the Prix Vermeille last month that it was decided she would get a chance to boost her record to 7 for 7 in Europe\u2019s most prestigious race. The last filly to take the Arc was Urban Sea in 1993. Zarkava, a 3-year-old filly owned by the Aga Khan, is the favorite in a 16-horse field and drew the inside No. 1 post for the nearly one-and-a-half-mile race at Longchamp.
