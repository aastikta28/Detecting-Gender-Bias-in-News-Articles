Gordon, who owns his own race team, was docked 50 driver points and 50 car owner points, and fined $15,000 for throwing a piece of roll bar padding onto the track. The debris caused Nascar to call a caution, which helped Gordon to his 10th-place finish but hurt Burton\u2019s result. Gordon was also fined $15,000 and placed on probation until the end of the year.", "snippet": "Nascar penalized Robby Gordon yesterday for causing a caution Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway that affected the race outcome for the championship contender Jeff Burton.
