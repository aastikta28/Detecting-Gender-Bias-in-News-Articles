B. Holmes with a bogey on the first playoff hole. Casey, a 31-year-old Englishman, has nine international victories but had never won in the United States. Holmes hooked his tee shot into the pond on the playoff hole. He needed a win to earn a trip to this week\u2019s Masters; he is the only player from last year\u2019s Ryder Cup who failed to qualify. Casey bogeyed the 18th hole in regulation, completing a round of 72 and tying Holmes (69) at 11 under par.", "snippet": "Paul Casey won the Shell Houston Open in Humble, Tex., for his first PGA Tour victory, beating J.
