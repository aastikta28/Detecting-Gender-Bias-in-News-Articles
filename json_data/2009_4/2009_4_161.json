Quality Road, a son of Elusive Quality, sustained a slight quarter crack, or a split in the hoof wall, in his right hind foot after looking superb March 28 in winning the Florida Derby. He has won three of four starts. His trainer, Jimmy Jerkens, noticed a second quarter crack on the inside of his right front hoof on Thursday morning after Quality Road returned from a gallop at Belmont Park. Jerkens called in the hoof specialist Ian McKinlay, who patched the first injury. McKinlay treated the tender feet of Big Brown, who won the Derby and the Preakness last year. The injury was repaired Friday; Jerkens said he hoped to send out Quality Road for a gallop on Saturday.", "snippet": "Quality Road, considered a favorite in the Kentucky Derby, has developed more hoof problems that jeopardize his chances of competing May 2 in the 135th running of the Derby.
