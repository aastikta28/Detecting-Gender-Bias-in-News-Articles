Gatlin had sued those groups in federal court, saying his rights were violated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. He said he was discriminated against because his first of two doping violations, in 2001, was for taking prescribed medication to treat attention deficit disorder. Because that penalty was on the books, his second violation, in 2006, triggered a suspension that kept him from defending his 2004 Olympic gold medal at the Beijing Games. Gatlin\u2019s lawyer said the settlement documents were not final.", "snippet": "The former Olympic 100-meter champion Justin Gatlin has reached an out-of-court settlement with the United States Olympic Committee, the United States Anti-Doping Agency, USA Track & Field and the International Association of Athletics Federations....", "subsection_name": "More Sports", "male": ["Justin"]}]
