Barcelona of Spain and the Red Bulls of Major League Soccer at Giants Stadium was billed as an exhibition. It was more like a clinic as the Red Bulls were outclassed and outplayed. Barcelona, playing its second and last game on its United States tour, toyed with the Red Bulls, especially in the first half, when Samuel Eto\u2019o and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez each scored two goals in a 6-2 victory. The Red Bulls\u2019 goals were scored by Seth Stammler and Jorge Rojas. The attendance, 38,152, was far short of the 79,002 two years ago when the teams played. What was different this time? The Brazilian star Ronaldinho now calls A.C. Milan home and the Argentine striker Lionel Messi was in China for the Olympics.", "snippet": "The game between F.C.
