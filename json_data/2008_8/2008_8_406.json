Starting Sept. 15, Russo will return to afternoon drive time, from 2 to 7 p.m., putting him in competition with Francesa. Perhaps more important, as Sirius XM tries to build Russo into a star, he will be the boss of a crew of hosts on his channel, which will get under way in October.", "snippet": "A week ago, Chris Russo was Mike Francesa\u2019s partner on WFAN, and they were a month short of celebrating their 19th anniversary as sports-talk radio\u2019s most powerful team.
