Pederson, along with Coach Bill Callahan, has been heavily criticized after a series of one-sided losses this season. The most recent was a 45-14 loss to Oklahoma State on Saturday with the former Cornhuskers coach Tom Osborne and his 1997 national title team in attendance. Over the past two weeks, the Huskers (4-3) have lost by a combined margin of 86-20, dropping a 41-6 decision at Missouri two weeks ago.
