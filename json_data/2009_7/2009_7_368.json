Play started with 185 players, and 38 were eliminated in two hours, despite starting with many chips relative to minimum bets. Hachem said the overaggressive style was disrespectful to the tournament. Hachem was eliminated later in the day, leaving last year&#8217;s winner, Peter Eastgate, as the only former main event champion in the tournament.", "snippet": "Joe Hachem, the 2005 World Series of Poker champion, said he had lost respect for a new brand of aggressive players who seemed to want to gamble all their chips on every hand in the main event.
