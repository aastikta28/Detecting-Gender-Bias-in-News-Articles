Our approach to treating concussions is conservative and involves a team of specialists including a neurologist, neuropsychologist, and neuroradiologist. No player has been allowed to return to a game unless he is entirely without symptoms; has normal mental status testing; and has a normal neurological examination. Most recently any player who has loss of consciousness is not allowed to return to play regardless of symptoms, results of mental status testing or neurological examination. Medical staff and coaches continue to follow the player through the game and if the status of the player changes, he is removed. Players are expected and encouraged to report their symptoms, both on the day of the game and thereafter. However, in-game decisions are only one component of the process.", "snippet": "With any injury, player safety is our foremost concern.
