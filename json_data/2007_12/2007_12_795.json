The Eagles were successful last week by being physical with Brady and his receivers; the Ravens have a reputation for playing the same way. It could be cold and windy at game time, so Willis McGahee could see extra carries. He has 910 yards this season, but he has never scored against the Patriots and has never played on a team that has defeated them. Losing Rosevelt Colvin for the season was the first serious injury for New England this year. Then again, the Ravens, who have lost five in a row and average 23.7 fewer points a game than the Patriots, may not be able to take advantage of his absence.
