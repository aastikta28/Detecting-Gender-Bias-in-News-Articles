A maximum of two players from each country that did not already have two or more among the top 15 would also be eligible. (The United States has five men\u2019s players ranked in the top 15, including No. 1 Tiger Woods and No. 5 Phil Mickelson.) A three-hole playoff would break any ties for the gold, silver and bronze medals.
