Williams, after winning the Australian Open, did not practice until Monday and was relieved to get through the first round of this indoor tournament she has won twice. Her second-round match was easier, as Williams took less than an hour to beat Sprem, a qualifier from Croatia, converting her first match point with a forehand return winner down the line. Next up will be the French qualifier Emilie Loit, whom Williams has not met in six years.", "snippet": "Top-ranked Serena Williams showed no signs of the illness that kept her bedridden last week as she ousted Karolina Sprem, 6-1, 6-2, to reach the quarterfinals of the Paris Open.
