Stan's fall is as swift as his ascent. He is ruined and starts drinking heavily, until he is forced to take on a job in the same shoddy carnival he started in, but this time as the \"geek,\" a freak show attraction who eats live chickens to earn his keep.", "snippet": "Stanton Carlisle, a womanizing, small-time carnival huckster obtains the secrets of a fake mind reader and becomes a high-society spiritualist.
