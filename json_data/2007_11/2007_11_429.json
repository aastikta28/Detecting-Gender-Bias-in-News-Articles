Johnson holds an 86-point lead over his Hendrick Motorsports teammate Jeff Gordon heading into the season-ending Ford 400 tomorrow. Johnson qualified at 176.788 miles an hour on the 1.5-mile oval, ahead of Ryan Newman (176.569) and Kasey Kahne (176.350).The pole virtually assured Johnson of earning the 5-point bonus for leading at least one race lap tomorrow. If he does lead a lap, Johnson needs to finish only 19th or better to win the Chase title, regardless of what Gordon does. Gordon will be starting 11th. Even without leading a lap, Johnson can wrap up his second championship by finishing 18th or better.", "snippet": "Jimmie Johnson, the reigning Nextel Cup champion and the current points leader, won his fourth pole of the season and the 13th of his career yesterday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
