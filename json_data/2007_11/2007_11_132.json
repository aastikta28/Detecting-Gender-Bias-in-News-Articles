Willie Parker was held to 52 rushing yards last week, but Miami entered the weekend with the N.F.L.&#8217;s worst run defense, allowing 154.9 yards a game. This will be Miami linebacker Joey Porter&#8217;s first game against his former team. Porter went to three Pro Bowls in eight seasons as a Steeler, but was cut in a money-saving move in the off-season. He signed a five-year, $32 million contract with the Dolphins.
