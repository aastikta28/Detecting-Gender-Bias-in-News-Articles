Kick returner Joshua Cribbs, one of the few Browns having an excellent year, backed Lewis, but Coach Romeo Crennel was furious. Crennel could use a little less criticism and a little more yardage from Lewis, who does not have a 100-yard game this season. Brady Quinn did everything but win in his first start, producing 30 points, 239 passing yards and 2 touchdowns. Buffalo\u2019s Trent Edwards has been less impressive lately; he has five interceptions and three fumbles during the Bills\u2019 losing streak.
