But as often happens in endurance events, attrition took its toll.The Ganassi car had been swapping leads with the Ford Riley shared by Nascar&#8217;s A. J. Allmendinger, Ian James, Burt Frisselle and John Pew. The Ford Riley car, driven by Frisselle, was only seconds behind the leader when a tire blew, damaging the suspension midway through the 21st hour and knocking it out of contention.", "snippet": "Juan Pablo Montoya teamed with Dario Franchitti, Scott Pruett and Memo Rojas to give Chip Ganassi&#8217;s team an unprecedented third consecutive victory in the Rolex 24-Hour race in Daytona Beach, Fla.Other than a minor handling problem for Pruett...", "subsection_name": "More Sports", "male": ["Juan"]}]
