Starter Chien-Ming Wang asked for $4.6 million, $600,000 more than the Yankees\u2019 offer; and reliever Brian Bruney asked for $845,000 while the Yankees offered $640,000. The Yankees are likely to settle with Bruney before a hearing. They believe their offer to Wang is fair, but a settlement seems possible because the figures are not far apart. Can\u00f3\u2019s case is trickier, since the salary he is seeking would be higher than the $4.5 million earned by Justin Morneau of the Twins last season, after Morneau had won the Most Valuable Player award. The Yankees are unlikely to sign any of the players to long-term contracts, because their general policy is to make one-year deals until players reach free agency.", "snippet": "The Yankees exchanged salary arbitration figures with three players on Friday and signed another, infielder Wilson Betemit, to a one-year, $1.165 million deal.The biggest difference in figures was with second baseman Robinson Can\u00f3, who asked for...", "subsection_name": "Baseball", "male": ["Wilson", "Brian", "Justin"]}]
