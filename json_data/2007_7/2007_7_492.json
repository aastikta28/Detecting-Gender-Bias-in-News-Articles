Each player was suspended by the league Saturday without pay and was scheduled to miss the first seven games of next season. Artest would lose a little more than $470,000 in salary, about $50,000 more than Jackson.Jackson released a statement through the Golden State Warriors saying he accepted his suspension. But the union, comparing the penalties with other recent suspensions given to players for off-the-court reasons, may take action. Artest pleaded no contest in May to a misdemeanor domestic violence charge that stemmed from a dispute with his wife on March 5. Jackson pleaded guilty last month to a felony count of criminal recklessness for firing a gun outside an Indianapolis strip club last fall, when he was with the Indiana Pacers. The union has 30 days from Saturday to file an appeal to be heard by an arbitrator.", "snippet": "The N.B.A. players union is considering an appeal of the seven-game suspensions given to Ron Artest and Stephen Jackson for legal issues.
