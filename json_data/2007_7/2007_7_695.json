He was applauded by fans and a government delegation. &#8220;I&#8217;m enormously proud to be here in Geneva with you for the second time,&#8221; said Bertarelli, who made Switzerland the first European nation to successfully defend the title in yachting&#8217;s premier event. Switzerland scored a major upset in 2003 by taking the Cup from New Zealand, bringing sport&#8217;s oldest international trophy to Europe for the first time in more than 150 years. On Tuesday, Alinghi&#8217;s dramatic one-second win over Emirates Team New Zealand in Valencia, Spain, ended the closest America&#8217;s Cup regatta in 24 years, a 5-2 Swiss victory.
