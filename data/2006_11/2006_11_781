Gordon, who owns his own race team, was docked 50 driver points and 50 car owner points, and fined $15,000 for throwing a piece of roll bar padding onto the track. The debris caused Nascar to call a caution, which helped Gordon to his 10th-place finish but hurt Burton\u2019s result. Gordon was also fined $15,000 and placed on probation until the end of the year.", "headline": {"main": "Robby Gordon Is Penalized", "print_headline": "ROBBY GORDON IS PENALIZED"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "90", "_id": "54a5c5107988102023c94c1e", "snippet": "Nascar penalized Robby Gordon yesterday for causing a caution Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway that affected the race outcome for the championship contender Jeff Burton.
