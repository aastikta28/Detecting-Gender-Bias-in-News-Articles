Greg Norman, who designed the El Cameleon course in Riviera Maya, Mexico, missed the cut with a 79. Norman could not recover from an early five-hole stretch of three bogeys and a double bogey. He finished at nine over, missing the cut by five strokes. The first-round leader, John Merrick, shot a 68 to remain on top at six-under 132. Brian Gay was a stroke back after a 67.", "headline": {"main": "Price Advances in Mexico", "print_headline": "Price Leads In Mexico", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Golf"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "125", "_id": "547e59af7988107cec11b438", "snippet": "Nick Price overcame a stiff wind to shoot one of the best rounds of the day at the Mayakoba Golf Classic, a two-under-par 68 that moved him to two-under 138 for the tournament, putting him in a tie for eighth and allowing him to advance to the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/sports/golf/23sportsbriefs-pga.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Golf", "keywords": [{"value": "Price, Nick", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Norman, Greg", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Gay, Brian", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "persons"}], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "organization": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2008-02-23T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
