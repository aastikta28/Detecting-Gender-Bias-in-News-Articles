Another lapse of concentration on the next hole resulted in a three-putt from about 12 feet for a bogey.

At the end of the day, I did hit some quality shots out there, so you know they\u2019re still in the system.\u201dThe field was chasing John Merrick, who holed a roughly 50-foot putt on his final shot for a six-under-par 64 and a one-stroke lead.", "headline": {"main": "Norman Lets It Get Away", "print_headline": "Norman Lets It Get Away", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Golf"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": "217", "_id": "547e4f337988107cec11b349", "snippet": "Playing crisply on a course he designed, Greg Norman used a run of birdies to move up to fifth place at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, on Thursday.
