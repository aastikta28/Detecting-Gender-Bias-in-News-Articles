But if the 25-year-old Hall qualifies, he said he was unlikely to go.In a telephone call from his training base in Big Bear Lake, Calif., to the New York Track Writers Association, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I would go because I don\u2019t think it would fit into my buildup.\u201dThe buildup is for the London Marathon on April 13. Last April, Hall ran London in 2 hours 8 minutes 24 seconds, the fastest marathon debut ever by an American.
