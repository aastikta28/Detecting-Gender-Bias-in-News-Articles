Suddenly, their car hits a deer, leading the shaken family to a terrifying encounter with the leader of a posse of local hunters that had been pursuing the animal. Miles witnesses the angry hunter's \"mercy killing\" of the wounded stag though his parents do their best to protect him. As they settle into the farmhouse, the quiet and isolation begin to erode their sense of well-being, with the psychotic hunter seemingly at the root of it all.
