Cink lost the outright lead when his tee shot rolled up against a tree on the par-5 14th, leading to bogey. The only consolation was making a 50-foot birdie on the 17th hole, allowing him to join a six-way tie for second.", "headline": {"main": "O\u2019hair Wins as Cink Falters", "print_headline": "O\u2019hair Wins as Cink Falters", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Golf"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": "184", "_id": "547eee4e7988107cec11c1d8", "snippet": "Sean O\u2019Hair took advantage of a stunning collapse by Stewart Cink on Sunday to win the PODS Championship in Palm Harbor, Fla., closing with a two-under-par 69 to energize his PGA Tour career and earn a trip to the Masters.O\u2019Hair, who had not won...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/10/sports/golf/10sportsbriefs-pods.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Golf", "keywords": [{"value": "Golf", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "O'Hair, Sean", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Cink, Stewart", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "persons"}], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "organization": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2008-03-10T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
