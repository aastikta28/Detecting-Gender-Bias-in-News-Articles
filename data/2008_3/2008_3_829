Gordon had a fast lap of 185.251 miles an hour on the 1.5-mile oval, easily faster than Dale Earnhardt Jr.&#8217;s 184.852. In Las Vegas, Gordon was not seriously hurt after bouncing off the car driven by Matt Kenseth and slamming into the wall. The impact tore apart the front of his car, leaving his radiator steaming on the track. On Friday night, Gordon said, &#8220;I was sore, but none of the soreness affected me in the racecar.&#8221; Carl Edwards, coming off two wins in a row, but under the shadow this week of a Nascar penalty, qualified fourth at 183.287.
