While the ban is tough, it is not nearly as tough as the one proposed by Kentucky&#8217;s Equine Drug Research Council earlier this month. That group called for suspensions of up to three years for trainers and veterinarians whose horses fail a steroid test, but the authority revised the penalties, capping them at a 60-day suspension for first-time offenders.", "headline": {"main": "Kentucky Approves Steroid Ban", "print_headline": "Kentucky Approves Steroid Ban", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Horse Racing"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "115", "_id": "547733257988103571030b10", "snippet": "Kentucky horse racing regulators on Monday approved a sweeping steroid ban for the state&#8217;s thoroughbred and standardbred races, but dramatically toned down the proposed penalties for trainers whose horses test positive.
