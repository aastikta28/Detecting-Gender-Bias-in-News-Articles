Sammy Villegas, who played for four years at Toledo, is accused of shaving points in games during the 2004-5 and 2005-6 seasons. Villegas, a guard who finished his career in 2006, also paid money to another player who took part in the point-shaving scheme, prosecutors said. The other player was not charged or named in the bill. Villegas was charged with conspiracy to influence sports contests by bribery. Prosecutors said he received money and other gifts in exchange for fixing games.", "headline": {"main": "Fixing Charge at Toledo", "print_headline": "Fixing Charge at Toledo", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | College Basketball"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": "122", "_id": "5476869b798810357102fb46", "snippet": "A former Toledo basketball player was charged with fixing games, a little over a year after a former Toledo football player was charged with point-shaving, according to a federal bill of information filed in the United States District Court in...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/sports/ncaabasketball/07sportsbriefs-FIXINGCHARGE_BRF.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "College Basketball", "keywords": [{"value": "Basketball", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Bribery", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "organization": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2008-08-07T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
