That gesture became a symbol of sportsmanship in match play between countries and continents. Then again, this was only the first day, and it was clear the Americans were in charge.", "headline": {"main": "Americans Take Charge", "print_headline": "Americans Take Charge", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing  | Golf"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "156", "_id": "54859fa779881040e1d4c4a9", "snippet": "The Americans got off to a near-perfect start yesterday in the Presidents Cup, getting superb play from veterans and rookies alike in winning five and a half points out of the six alternate-shot matches at Royal Montreal.
