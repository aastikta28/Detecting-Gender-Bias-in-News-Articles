Southern California was voted No. 1 by the media panel, but the Trojans lost some support. U.S.C. received 62 first-place votes in the preseason poll. But after a lackluster 38-10 victory against Idaho, the Trojans received only 59 first-place votes.", "headline": {"main": "Michigan Plummets From A.P.
