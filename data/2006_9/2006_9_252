Championship yesterday when Frank Esposito Jr. three-putted from 3 feet for a bogey on the final hole. Britton sank a 5-foot putt to save par on the 18th green at Manasquan River Golf Club in Brielle, and then sat back and watched Esposito miss a short but slippery birdie putt to win the $57,000 tournament. Esposito ran his first putt 6 feet past the hole. He then missed his par putt coming back up the hill to give Britton a one-shot victory. Britton had a final round one-under-par 71 and finished at four-under 212.", "headline": {"main": "Britton Wins New Jersey P.G.A.", "print_headline": "BRITTON WINS NEW JERSEY P.G.A."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": "103", "_id": "54b1e3cb798810617c69a42a", "snippet": "Bill Britton won his second consecutive New Jersey P.G.A.
