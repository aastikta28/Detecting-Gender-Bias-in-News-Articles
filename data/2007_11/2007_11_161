She was slightly off form in her subsequent triple salchow, but she recovered to knock off a late-program double axel. The gold in Moscow and her victory at the Cup of China qualifies Kim for the Grand Prix final, which she won last year.Yukari Nakano of Japan won silver and also qualified for the Grand Prix final.Joannie Rochette of Canada climbed from fifth place after the short program to win bronze.Beatrisa Liang was the top American, finishing eighth.In ice dancing, Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin of Russia were in first place after the original dance segment with a lead of more than 10 points on Nathalie Pechalat and Fabian Bourzat of France.
