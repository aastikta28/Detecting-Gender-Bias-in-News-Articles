The Steelers are 5-0 at home, where they have outscored their opponents, 154-54, and outgained their opponents by 1,804-923. Willie Parker was held to 52 rushing yards last week, but Miami entered the weekend with the N.F.L.&#8217;s worst run defense, allowing 154.9 yards a game. This will be Miami linebacker Joey Porter&#8217;s first game against his former team. Porter went to three Pro Bowls in eight seasons as a Steeler, but was cut in a money-saving move in the off-season. He signed a five-year, $32 million contract with the Dolphins. Porter was certainly a leader on the team, but Pittsburgh has had the No. 1 defense without him.", "headline": {"main": "Monday\u2019s Matchup", "print_headline": "Today\u2019s Matchup"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "128", "_id": "54881ba2798810726e2d3d7c", "snippet": "After a stunning loss to the Jets last week, Pittsburgh is happy to be back at Heinz Field.
