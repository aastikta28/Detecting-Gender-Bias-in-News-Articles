Fortunately for the Titans, the Broncos rank 31st against the run, giving up 151 yards a game. LenDale White will have some help attacking that defense with the expected return of Chris Brown from an injury. Travis Henry&#8217;s sore knee may keep him out of the Broncos&#8217; lineup, leaving Selvin Young to stare down the Titans&#8217; second-ranked defense. If he cannot move the ball on the ground, Jay Cutler (nine touchdowns, nine interceptions) will have to pass it. The good news for Cutler is that he may not have to worry about Albert Haynesworth, who is nursing a hamstring injury.
