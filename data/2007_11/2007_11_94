{"type_of_material": "Brief", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Sports", "lead_paragraph": "Lawyers for four people convicted two years ago in the Balco steroids case filed a motion yesterday to oppose a government order that they return or destroy all grand jury transcripts and other sealed materials in the case, according to Victor Conte Jr., founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative. The defendants were given materials to prepare their defense; they later pleaded guilty. The 18-page motion says the government request \u2014 which was made under seal and signed by a judge Sept. 11 \u2014 is \u201cfutile\u201d and \u201cunenforceable\u201d because the sealed materials have already been widely shared, leaked and published outside of the criminal defense team. It also argues that the order would pose \u201can open-ended danger\u201d of further leak investigations against the defendants, Conte, James Valente (Balco\u2019s former vice president), Barry Bonds\u2019s former trainer Greg Anderson and the track coach Remi Korchemny. It argues they may need the materials to prepare for testimony in future cases. Troy Ellerman Jr., a former defense lawyer, was sentenced earlier this year to two and a half years in prison for obstruction of justice after admitting he had leaked grand jury transcripts to a reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle. Natalya LaBauve, spokeswoman for the United States attorney, declined to comment.", "headline": {"main": "Defendants Oppose Request", "print_headline": "Defendants Oppose Request", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing  | doping"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": "208", "_id": "5488268a798810726e2d3e73", "snippet": "Lawyers for four people convicted two years ago in the Balco steroids case filed a motion yesterday to oppose a government order that they return or destroy all grand jury transcripts and other sealed materials in the case, according to Victor Conte...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/27/sports/27sportsbriefs-Balco.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Steroids", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Decisions and Verdicts", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Conte, Victor Jr", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Bonds, Barry", "is_major": "N", "rank": "5", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Anderson, Greg", "is_major": "N", "rank": "6", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Wilson, Duff", "is_major": "N", "rank": "7", "name": "persons"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Duff", "lastname": "WILSON"}], "original": "By DUFF WILSON"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-11-27T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
