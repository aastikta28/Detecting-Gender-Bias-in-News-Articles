Earlier yesterday, Andy Roddick overcame a lapse in the second set to defeat Nikolay Davydenko, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. Federer will probably have to beat Roddick and Davydenko to reach the semifinals.Federer, who won three Grand Slam titles this year, has already clinched the No. 1 ranking for the fourth straight year.
