Last week, a state judge ordered Cunningham\u2019s and Gallion\u2019s assets, including Midnight Cry Stables, turned over to the 418 plaintiffs to satisfy a $42 million judgment stemming from a lawsuit against Gallion and Cunningham over their handling of the settlement.", "headline": {"main": "Curlin Ownership Shifts", "print_headline": "Curlin Ownership Shifts", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing  | Horse Racing"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "145", "_id": "548745f2798810726e2d2dc6", "snippet": "The ownership of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic winner Curlin had another shakeup.
