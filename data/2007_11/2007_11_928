Jason Varitek caught the final strikeout Sunday night to complete a four-game sweep of Colorado, and he put the ball in his back pocket. Varitek said after the game that he would give the souvenir to the team, but yesterday he said he gave it to closer Jonathan Papelbon. Papelbon does not know where the ball is, his agent, Sam Levinson said.Ownership of the last ball became an issue in 2004, when the Red Sox swept St. Louis. Doug Mientkiewicz, who caught the final out, kept the ball. Larry Lucchino, the team president, wanted it back. A settlement was reached, and Mientkiewicz loaned the ball to the team for a year and then donated it to the Hall of Fame.", "headline": {"main": "Series-Clinching Ball Lost", "print_headline": "Series-Clinching Ball Lost", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing  | Baseball"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "139", "_id": "548706a47988101981f9ff0f", "snippet": "The last ball from Boston\u2019s 2007 World Series victory may not get back to the Red Sox, after all.
