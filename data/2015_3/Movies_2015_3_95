It also marks the anniversary of David's wife Gillian's death. She died in a boating accident on her birthday two years ago. To David, it could have been yesterday. Hoping to help David overcome his grief, Paul and Esther bring an attractive single woman with them to the island. But he's not over Gillian. In fact, David is completely in love with her. It's as though the strength of his devotion just might bring her back. As the family celebrates the weekend with the traditional karaoke singing and a sand castle competition, relationships are re-examined and truths are revealed. When David discovers that his obsession with his late wife has damaged his precious relationship with Rachel, he realizes he must do everything in his power to regain his daughter's love--even if it means letting go of Gillian.", "headline": {"main": "To Gillian On Her 37Th Birthday: Who Are You?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "163", "_id": "5515257679881034ed52c9d6", "snippet": "Laboy Day weekend on Nantucket Island marks a family reunion for David Lewis and his teenage daughter, Rachel along with his sister-in-law Esther and brother-in-law Paul.
