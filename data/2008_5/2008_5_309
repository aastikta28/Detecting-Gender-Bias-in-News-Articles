Pattie replaces Jimmy Elledge, who was put in charge of the car four races ago in a crew shakeup at Chip Ganassi Racing. Elledge initially exchanged places with Donnie Wingo, who guided Montoya&#8217;s transition from Formula One to Nascar, but was moved to Reed Sorenson&#8217;s crew in the swap. Montoya is 16th in points with one top-10 finish this season, a second last month in Elledge&#8217;s first race leading the crew. He then finished 32nd in Richmond and 23rd in Darlington.", "headline": {"main": "A Third Crew Chief for Montoya", "print_headline": "A Third Crew Chief For Montoya", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Auto Racing"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": "109", "_id": "54819bab7988103739e1833b", "snippet": "Juan Pablo Montoya will have his third crew chief in a month when Brian Pattie takes over the No. 42 Dodge for this week&#8217;s race in Concord, N.C.
