Sakic, who has played all 17 seasons with the Avalanche franchise, will turn 37 next month. He said that he thought a one-year contract extension was fair to both sides, but that he hoped to play at least two more seasons. Financial terms were not disclosed. Sakic ranks 11th on the N.H.L.'s career list in points (1,489), 15th in assists (915) and 17th in goals (574). He has more overtime playoff goals (seven) than anyone. Only Steve Yzerman has a longer tenure with the same team (22 seasons), and only five players have scored more points with one organization (Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Gordie Howe, Ray Bourque and Yzerman).", "headline": {"main": "Avalanche Re-signs Sakic", "print_headline": "AVALANCHE RE-SIGNS SAKIC"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": "123", "_id": "54b53725798810566ec1ab32", "snippet": "Joe Sakic, the Avalanche captain, signed a one-year deal yesterday to stay in Colorado.
