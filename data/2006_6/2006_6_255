He replaced Marc Crawford, who was fired in April after the Canucks missed the playoffs for the first time in five seasons. Crawford has since been hired as coach of the Los Angeles Kings. Vigneault, 45, coached the Canadiens for more than three seasons (1997-2001) and spent last season behind the bench of the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League. He led the Moose to their first 100-point season and the second round of the playoffs. Vigneault was 109-113-39-5 in Montreal. After a strong 1999-2000 season, the Canadiens started the next season 5-8-6-1, and Vigneault was fired after 20 games.", "headline": {"main": "Vigneault to Coach Canucks", "print_headline": "VIGNEAULT TO COACH CANUCKS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": "127", "_id": "54b5370b798810566ec1ab2f", "snippet": "Alain Vigneault, a former coach of the Montreal Canadiens, was hired yesterday as coach of the Vancouver Canucks, who promoted him from their minor league affiliate.
