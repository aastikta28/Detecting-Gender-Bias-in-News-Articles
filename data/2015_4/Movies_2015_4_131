Since the apocalypse, the lengthy, desolate stretches of highway in the Australian outback have become bloodstained battlegrounds. Max has seen too many innocents and fellow officers murdered by the bomb's savage offspring, bestial marauding bikers for whom killing, rape, and looting is a way of life. He just wants to retire and spend time with his wife and son but lets his boss talk him into taking a peaceful vacation and starts to reconsider. Then his world is shattered as a gang led by the evil Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) murders his family in retaliation for the death of one of its members. Dead inside, Max straps on his helmet and climbs into a souped-up V-8 racing machine to seek his bloody revenge.", "headline": {"main": "Mad Max (Trailer 1)"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "138", "_id": "5538b27b798810052f6a6aed", "snippet": "Max Rockatansky is a motorcycle policeman in the near future who is tired of his job.
