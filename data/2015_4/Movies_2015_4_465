On these streets over the past 30 years, more than 15,000 people have been murdered in an ongoing cycle of gang violence that continues unabated.  It was here, just a few miles from the gated communities and sprawling mansions of Beverly Hills and Bel Air, where this nation's most bloody and costly outbreaks of civil unrest erupted--not once, but twice, 27 years and just three miles apart.", "headline": {"main": "Crips And Bloods: Made In America (Clip)"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "149", "_id": "551fae65798810384d4c9d2d", "snippet": "A cluster of neighborhoods lies in the heart of Southern California, streets and boulevards forming a grid between concrete ribbons of freeway.
