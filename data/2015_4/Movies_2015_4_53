The stakes have never been higher in the battle to save man from hell on earth and only Paul Merchant has the ability and knowledge to trap the Black Prince of Hell--Pinhead. The fate of the world rides in their final cataclysmic confrontation.

The descendants of Lemarchand are forever cursed, until somehow they can find a way to close the portal. Paul Merchant is their final hope.", "headline": {"main": "Hellraiser: Bloodline"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "139", "_id": "553ca61c798810080a4fc6df", "snippet": "In the 22nd century a brilliant scientist strives to banish the evil which his ancestor had unwittingly leashed upon the world.
