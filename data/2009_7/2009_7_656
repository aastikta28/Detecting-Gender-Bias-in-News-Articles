Finchem was asked to consider delaying the change for one year so that players and manufacturers could continue testing, and the U.S.G.A. said it would follow the tour&#8217;s lead. Finchem said it was in the best interests of golf to stay on schedule.", "headline": {"main": "No Delay for Equipment Rule Change", "print_headline": "No Delay For Rule Change", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Golf"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": "118", "_id": "54537f427988101196a59854", "snippet": "Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour commissioner, decided not to delay a new rule that will change the grooves in irons and wedges next year.
