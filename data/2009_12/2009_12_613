He won 10 titles with all-white teams, not 12, and four titles with integrated teams, not two. The article also provided an erroneous distinction for Stan Rome, the father of a current player on the team. He was on the fifth integrated team, not on the first.", "headline": {"main": "Corrections", "print_headline": "Corrections"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": "109", "_id": "545939a579881027068435a5", "snippet": "An article on Nov. 26 about the turmoil enveloping the Valdosta High School football program, which has won 23 Georgia state championships but none since 1998, misstated the year the school was integrated.
