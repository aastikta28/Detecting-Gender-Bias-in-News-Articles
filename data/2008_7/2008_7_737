Scott pleaded guilty to the gross misdemeanor as jury selection was scheduled to begin in his trial. Scott\u2019s lawyer, Joe Friedberg, said the other charges would be dismissed when Scott is sentenced July 24. Friedberg said Scott said he had no intent to injure the boy. Scott\u2019s plea was to an amended child endangerment count \u2014 not the original one that accused him of keeping a loaded, unsecured handgun in his nightstand, where a 2-year-old could reach it. Scott could face a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $3,000 fine.", "headline": {"main": "Ex-Vikings Lineman Pleads Guilty", "print_headline": "Ex-Vikings Lineman Pleads Guilty", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Pro Football"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "118", "_id": "5482dd2579881013551413b9", "snippet": "The former Minnesota Vikings defensive lineman Darrion Scott pleaded guilty to child endangerment for putting a plastic bag over the head of his 2-year-old son.
