In addition to Jack Nicklaus, Bob Jones and Willie Anderson, Ben Hogan also won the tournament four times. With a victory, Woods would become the second golfer, not the first, to win four in the same decade &#151; a distinction that belongs to Anderson, who won in 1901, 1903, 1904 and 1905. And Woods would become the seventh golfer &#151; not the third &#151; to defend his title successfully.", "headline": {"main": "Corrections", "print_headline": "Corrections"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": "112", "_id": "5453064a7988101196a58da9", "snippet": "An article on Wednesday about contenders to win the United States Open golf tournament this weekend omitted the name of a player who won the event four times and referred incorrectly to Tiger Woods&#8217;s place in history should he win his fourth...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/sports/18cxns-05.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-06-18T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
