Boris Karloff stars in frightening and tender performance as the most famous monster in history in this 75th anniversary edition set of the horror classic \"Frankenstein\" (1931), artistically directed by James Whale. This 2-disc set tells the tragic story of the misunderstood monster assembled from stolen spare human parts by Dr. Frankenstein, a man obsessed with creating life. In one of many liberties taken from Mary Shelley's original source material, the doctor's incompetent hunchback assistant Fritz chose the brain of a madman instead of a normal brain. After the hulking monster kills Fritz its own creator decides to destroy it. Special features includes commentary, a featurette on Boris Karloff, a documentary on Universal horror films, trivia, a theatrical trailer, and more!", "headline": {"main": "Frankenstein: I'm Maria"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "123", "_id": "56484e377988105f040ba0c3", "snippet": "It's Alive!
