Her first encounter with true romance (outside of the pages of a novel) convinces Doris that she and the mostly unaware John are meant for each other. In the cluttered house she shared with her late mother, Doris mines the Internet for information on her one-and-only, guided by the 13-year-old granddaughter of her best pal Roz. When Doris begins showing up at John's regular haunts, she wins over his Williamsburg friends with her eclectic vintage wardrobe, quirky naivet\u00e9 and unironic enthusiasm for their rooftop knitting circle. Her new life brings Doris a thrilling perspective, but also creates a rift between her and her longtime friends and family, who believe she's making a fool of herself over a guy half her age. Eager for all the experiences she has missed out on, Doris throws caution to the wind and follows her heart for the very first time", "headline": {"main": "Hello, My Name Is Doris"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "163", "_id": "565191057988106c85c17de7", "snippet": "When Doris Miller meets John Fremont, her company's hip new art director, sparks fly-at least for Doris.
