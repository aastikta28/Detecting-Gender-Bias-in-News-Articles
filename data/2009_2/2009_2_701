Bonds\u2019s lawyers filed a motion two weeks ago asking United States District Judge Susan Illston to throw out several pieces of evidence, including drug tests, doping calendars and handwritten notes. As part of that motion, the defense lawyers filed the evidence under seal. Illston said in the filing that members of the news media had asked her to make the documents public and that she would do so on Wednesday if Bonds\u2019s lawyers did not file another motion. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday for Illston to hear arguments about whether the evidence should be admitted at trial.", "headline": {"main": "Bonds Judge Set To Act", "print_headline": "Bonds Judge Set To Act", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Baseball"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": "123", "_id": "547265d37988103bd4a4b638", "snippet": "A federal judge in San Francisco said she planned to unseal evidence that Barry Bonds\u2019s lawyers are trying to have excluded from his perjury trial.
