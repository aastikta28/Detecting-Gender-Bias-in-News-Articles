Leipold said yesterday he has signed a letter of intent to sell his team to the local group. The eight partners put down $10 million as a deposit toward the purchase price of $193 million. The only partner from outside the Nashville area is William Del Biaggio III, who will have to sell his minority share in the San Jose Sharks when this deal closes. Leipold said he is excited to pass ownership to a group he knows is committed to Nashville.The bid was less than the $220 million offered by the Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie when Leipold announced May 24 that he had signed a letter of intent to sell his team. But Leipold said Balsillie ruined that deal by trying to move the Predators to Canada before money changed hands.", "headline": {"main": "Predators Sold", "kicker": "Hockey", "print_headline": "Predators Sold", "content_kicker": "Hockey"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "168", "_id": "5483e0687988106fd483d0dc", "snippet": "Craig Leipold, the owner of the N.H.L.\u2019s Predators, said he has finally sold the franchise, this time to a group of local businessmen and one California venture capitalist who want to keep the team in Nashville.
