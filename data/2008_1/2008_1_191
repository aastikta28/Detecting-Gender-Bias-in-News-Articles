The lawsuit, filed Wednesday on behalf of John Doe in Los Angeles County Superior Court, seeks an injunction to prevent the agency from ever testing the B sample. The agency originally planned to test the B sample Jan. 15, the lawsuit says, but after the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers demanded the agency scrap that test, the agency canceled it.The lawsuit calls for a jury trial and seeks to recoup damages the plaintiff claims were incurred when the antidoping agency revealed the case to race organizers and the U.C.L.A. testing lab.The plaintiff\u2019s name is redacted in the 25-page lawsuit, but the cyclist\u2019s lawyers are Maurice Suh and Howard Jacobs, the same team that represents Floyd Landis in his doping case.Landis told The Associated Press he was not the plaintiff.
