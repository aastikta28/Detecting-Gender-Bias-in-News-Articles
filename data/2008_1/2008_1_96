But as often happens in endurance events, attrition took its toll.The Ganassi car had been swapping leads with the Ford Riley shared by Nascar&#8217;s A. J. Allmendinger, Ian James, Burt Frisselle and John Pew. The Ford Riley car, driven by Frisselle, was only seconds behind the leader when a tire blew, damaging the suspension midway through the 21st hour and knocking it out of contention.", "headline": {"main": "Another Rolex Win for Ganassi Team", "kicker": "Sports Briefing | Auto Racing", "print_headline": "Another Rolex Win For Ganassi Team", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Auto Racing"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "163", "_id": "547d4f35798810275e3844da", "snippet": "Juan Pablo Montoya teamed with Dario Franchitti, Scott Pruett and Memo Rojas to give Chip Ganassi&#8217;s team an unprecedented third consecutive victory in the Rolex 24-Hour race in Daytona Beach, Fla.Other than a minor handling problem for Pruett...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/sports/othersports/28sportsbriefs-Ganassi.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "More Sports", "keywords": [{"value": "Montoya, Juan Pablo", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Automobile Racing", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By AP", "organization": "AP"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2008-01-28T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
