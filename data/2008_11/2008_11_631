Jimmy Walker, who needs a victory in the PGA Tour\u2019s final tournament to avoid going back to Q-school, opened with a 64 and was one shot behind with Scott Verplank and Kevin Streelman, who are both well inside the top 125 on the money list, the cutoff for keeping a card. Erik Compton, who received his second heart transplant just six months ago, shot 70. \u00b6Henrik Stenson of Sweden made a 20-foot birdie putt on his final hole for a seven-under 65 and a one-stroke lead over the defending champion, Phil Mickelson; Sergio Garc\u00eda; Anthony Kim; and Adam Scott in the HSBC Champions in Shanghai. Playing in rain, fog and smog, Garc\u00eda could have carded a 65, too, but he missed a 4-foot eagle putt on the 18th. The putt came after his 235-yard, 5-wood shot landed just below the hole and rolled close. shanghai.", "headline": {"main": "Matteson Leads at Disney", "print_headline": "Matteson Leads at Disney", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Golf"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "word_count": "191", "_id": "5479dde3798810519966965a", "snippet": "Troy Matteson opened the Children\u2019s Miracle Network Classic at Disney with an eagle on the Palm Course, ran off three straight birdies at the turn and wound up with a career-low round of nine-under 63 to take a one-shot lead Thursday in Lake Buena...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/sports/golf/07sportsbriefs-MATTESONLEAD_BRF.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Golf", "keywords": [{"value": "Golf", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Matteson, Troy", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "persons"}], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "organization": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2008-11-07T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
