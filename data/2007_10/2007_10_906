But Bryant was just running late because of a doctor&#8217;s appointment, according to the team, and he emerged from the training room minutes later.Bryant had not said much about the Lakers since late May after calling the team&#8217;s front office a mess and requesting a trade. He said he decided to keep a low profile after that, and the team did the same.&#8220;We purposely didn&#8217;t say anything because we wanted to keep things to ourselves,&#8221; Bryant said. &#8220;There was just too much going on &#151; things get misconstrued. We don&#8217;t need that. We don&#8217;t need any distractions for the season. There was never a doubt I was coming to camp. They knew that, I knew that.&#8221;.", "headline": {"main": "Bryant at Media Day", "print_headline": "Bryant At Media Day", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing  | pro basketball"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "155", "_id": "5485bdd479881040e1d4c82f", "snippet": "There was some uncertainty regarding Kobe Bryant&#8217;s presence at media day yesterday, and it increased after the entire Los Angeles Lakers roster except Bryant hit the floor for preseason promos and interviews shortly after the scheduled 10 a.m....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/sports/basketball/02sportsbriefs-kobe.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Pro Basketball", "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "organization": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-10-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
