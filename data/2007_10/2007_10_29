Martin Truex Jr., who led the most laps, smashed into the back of Hamlin\u2019s car and finished 31st. Hamlin slipped to 24th. \u201cThere are multiple teams that are showing positive for some level of water contamination level in their fuel,\u201d said John Darby, Nascar\u2019s Nextel Cup director.
