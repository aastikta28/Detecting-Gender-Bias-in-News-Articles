Last year&#8217;s wheelchair champions, Kurt Fearnley of Australia and Amanda McGrory of Champaign, Ill., will also return. The 30-year-old Prokopcuka could become the second woman to win the race three consecutive years. Grete Waitz of Norway won from 1978 to 1980 and 1982 to 1986. A victory would probably assure Prokopcuka, who was second in the Boston Marathon in April, of the $500,000 first prize in the World Marathon Majors&#8217; first two-year series.", "headline": {"main": "Marathon Champions Return", "print_headline": "Marathon Champions Return", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing  | Running"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "115", "_id": "548cd075798810543aba4aa3", "snippet": "Jelena Prokopcuka of Latvia, who won the women&#8217;s race at the New York City Marathon the past two years, and Marilson Gomes dos Santos of Brazil, the men&#8217;s upset winner last year, will compete in this year&#8217;s marathon, which is Nov....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/sports/othersports/20sportsbriefs-marathon.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "More Sports", "keywords": [{"value": "Prokopcuka, Jelena", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "New York City Marathon", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "New York City", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "glocations"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Frank", "lastname": "LITSKY"}], "original": "By FRANK LITSKY"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-07-20T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
