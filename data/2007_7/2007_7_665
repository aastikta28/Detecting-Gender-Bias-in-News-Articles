But the jury chose not to award punitive damages, which could have raised the award.Godfrey and another patron, David Anthony Kittrell, sued Iverson, a guard for the Denver Nuggets, for $20 million, saying they were beaten by his entourage in July 2005. The attacks, they said, followed their refusal to vacate the Eyebar club\u2019s V.I.P. section for Iverson.Iverson testified last week that he did not see the fight and left the club before the brawl became serious.
