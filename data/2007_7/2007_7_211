Weis nearly died after the operation in 2002. Ferguson and Hodin said internal bleeding was a well-known complication of the surgery. They said they believed the bleeding would stop and were concerned about a second operation because of the risk of a pulmonary embolism.", "headline": {"main": "Jury Rules for Weis\u2019s Doctors", "print_headline": "Jury Rules For Weis\u2019s Doctors", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing  | college football"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "143", "_id": "548d0103798810543aba4ed3", "snippet": "A jury in Boston found against Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis yesterday in his malpractice lawsuit against two doctors he said botched his care after he had gastric bypass surgery five years ago.The jury deliberated a few hours before finding that the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/sports/ncaafootball/25sportsbriefs-weis.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "College Football", "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "organization": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-07-25T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
