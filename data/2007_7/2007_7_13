But my doctor advised me it&#8217;s not a good idea to come back. If I have another spill, I&#8217;ll probably not be able to walk again.&#8221; Santos will be inducted into the Hall of Fame next week. Santos, from Concepci&#243;n, Chile, leaves the sport with more than 4,000 victories, but he will be remembered for his run in the Triple Crown with the New York-bred Funny Cide. He also won the 1999 Belmont Stakes aboard Lemon Drop Kid.", "headline": {"main": "Sports Briefing | Santos Retires", "kicker": "Horse Racing", "print_headline": "Sports Briefing | Santos Retires", "content_kicker": "Horse Racing"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": "143", "_id": "548d3bb4798810543aba53ee", "snippet": "Six months after breaking his back in a spill at Aqueduct, Jos&#233; Santos, who rode Funny Cide to victory in the 2003 Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, announced his retirement. &#8220;I am going to retire because my back is in real bad...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/sports/othersports/31sportsbriefs-santos.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "More Sports", "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "organization": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-07-31T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}
