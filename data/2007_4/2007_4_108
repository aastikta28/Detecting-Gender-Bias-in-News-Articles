Every two years, the committee votes on players who were not elected over a 15-year period by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Every four years, the committee considers executives, umpires and managers.However, in five ballots dating to 2003, the committee has failed to elect a single person. In the most recent results, Miller received 63 percent of the votes; 75 percent is needed.
