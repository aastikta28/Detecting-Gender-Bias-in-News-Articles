The owners, William Gallion and Shirley Cunningham Jr., are accused of defrauding clients of $94 million after winning a settlement from manufacturers of the diet drug fen-phen. A jury could not reach a verdict against them in July during a trial on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The new indictment charges the men with eight counts of wire fraud. Cunningham&#8217;s lawyer, Steven Dobson, questioned whether the newest indictment was a result of vindictiveness from prosecutors who failed to get a conviction. The two defendants bought Curlin, winner of last year&#8217;s Preakness, in 2004 before selling an 80 percent interest.", "headline": {"main": "Curlin Owners Indicted", "print_headline": "Curlin Owners Indicted", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Horse Racing"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": "119", "_id": "5477855479881006dca8ad2c", "snippet": "A federal grand jury issued new indictments against two part-owners of the 2007 Horse of the Year Curlin.
