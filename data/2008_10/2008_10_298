It is considered by its creator, Richard A. Brandt, to be a true gauge of a bat even though it does not account for swing speed or the outgoing speed of the ball. Brandt does not view it as an untrue gauge because of those factors. The error was repeated in some editions in a caption for a photograph of Brandt, a New York University physics professor who created the test in the mid-1990s. Because of an editing error, the professor\u2019s surname was also misspelled as Brant in one instance in some editions.", "headline": {"main": "Corrections", "print_headline": "Corrections"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "132", "_id": "5483a91d7988106fd483ccf6", "snippet": "Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about concerns over the safety of metal bats in youth baseball referred incorrectly in some editions to a test used by Little League to evaluate bats called Bat Performance Factor.
