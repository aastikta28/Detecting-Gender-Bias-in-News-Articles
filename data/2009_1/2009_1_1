Play was called because of darkness with three players, all above the cut line, still on the course. At nine under, Watney had a one-stroke lead over Charley Hoffman (68), Matt Kuchar (67) and the first-round co-leader James Nitties (69). Mickelson, the 1996 and 2005 winner, never recovered from a 76 on Thursday in his first round of the year. It was the first time Mickelson missed the cut in his season debut since he turned professional in 1992.", "headline": {"main": "Mickelson Misses Cut", "print_headline": "Mickelson Misses Cut", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Golf"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": "107", "_id": "547251537988103bd4a4b46d", "snippet": "While Phil Mickelson missed the projected cut by seven strokes, Nick Watney shot an eight-under-par 63 to take the second-round lead in the FBR Open in Scottsdale, Ariz.
