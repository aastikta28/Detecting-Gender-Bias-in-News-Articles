An arrest warrant charging Stallworth, 28, with D.U.I. manslaughter was filed in the March 14 accident that killed Mario Reyes, 59. If convicted, Stallworth would face up to 15 years in prison. Stallworth\u2019s blood-alcohol level after the crash was .126, well above Florida\u2019s legal limit of .08, according to results of a blood test. Stallworth, who was expected to surrender in court Thursday, released a statement last month saying he was \u201cgrief stricken\u201d over the accident. \u00b6A man who pleaded guilty to avoid a possible life sentence in the killing of Redskins safety Sean Taylor wants to back out of the deal, his lawyer said. Venjah Hunte, 21, would have served 29 years under the deal reached last May in exchange for his cooperation. Hunte\u2019s lawyer said he disagreed with his client\u2019s desire to withdraw his guilty plea, and that Hunte would appear in court Thursday. taylor.", "headline": {"main": "Stallworth Faces Manslaughter Charge", "print_headline": "Stallworth Faces Manslaughter Charge", "content_kicker": "Sports Briefing | Pro Football"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": "174", "_id": "546913757988101de50ec36c", "snippet": "Browns wide receiver Donte\u2019 Stallworth was charged Wednesday with killing a pedestrian in Miami last month while driving drunk after a night out at a South Beach nightspot.
